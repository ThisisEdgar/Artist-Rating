# 🎵 Artist Rating – Music Critique Web App

Welcome to **Artist Rating**, a music review platform where users can explore artists, rate songs, and leave critiques—with a sparkle of style (thanks to our dynamic star rating system ✨). Whether you're jamming to pop or dissecting jazz solos, this app is your stage.

> *"Everyone's a critic—Artist Rating just makes it prettier."*



## Project Overview

**Artist Rating** is a modern single-page application (SPA) built with **React**, featuring:

* Artist and song listings via a local API
* Interactive star-based rating system ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
* User-submitted comments on songs and artists
* Admin panel for moderating critiques
* Integration with the **Spotify Web API** for real-time data
* Lightweight testing and scalable structure



## Tech Stack

| Area            | Tool/Tech              | Purpose                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend        | React + React Router   | UI, navigation                                   |
| API Requests    | fetch API              | Data fetching                                    |
| Styling         | Custom CSS             | Component styling (check out the hover effects!) |
| Backend (local) | Express (assumed)      | Serving artist/song/comment data                 |
| External API    | Spotify Web API        | Real-world artist/song info                      |
| Testing         | @testing-library/react | Basic component testing                          |
| Utilities       | `createArray.js`       | Generate arrays for stars                        |


## How It Works

* **Home (`/`)** – Loads all artists from the API.
* **Songs (`/songs`)** – Displays songs by the selected artist, allowing users to leave ratings and comments.
* **Admin (`/admin`)** – Lets admins view and delete comments.

React's `useEffect`, state management, and props keep everything clean, modular, and efficient. Comments and ratings are synced via API calls to your backend and/or Spotify integration.



## Features

* ✅ View artists and songs
* ✅ Leave comments and star ratings
* ✅ Admin panel to moderate content
* ✅ Responsive UI with smooth hover effects
* ⚠️ Basic testing in place
